Cross validation
================

In all previous examples we showed the training performance of the models. However,
in practice it is much more interesting how well a model performs on
unseen data, i.e., the generalizability of the model. We can use `crossvalidation`_ for this.

# Sklearn provides a very handy way of performing cross validation. For this
# purpose we firstly create a pipeline and initiate a sklearn object that will
# repeatedly create k folds for us.

# Create a scaler instance
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Create a GMLVQ  model instance
model = GMLVQ(
    distance_type="adaptive-squared-euclidean",

)

# Link them together (Note this will work as it should in a CV setting, i.e., it's fitted to the
# training data and predict is used for the testing data which makes sure the test data is
# scaled using the tranformation parameters found during training.
pipeline = make_pipeline(scaler, model)

# Create an object that n_repeat times creates k=10  folds.
repeated_10_fold = RepeatedKFold(n_splits=10, n_repeats=10)

# Call the cross_val_score using all created instances and loaded data. Note it can accept
# different and also multiple scoring parameters
